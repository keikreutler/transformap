# 15MMM #

------------------------------

In May 2015, the first TransforMap **global** test mapping “15MMM” (2015 Mapping Month May) is bringing together selected communities from different parts of the world, who partner through TransforMap to meet two goals:

- Contribute their views, experiences and needs to the collective mapping effort of TransforMap to map alternative economies and social innovation.
- Test at a global level and provide feedback about the various TransforMap elements: [taxonomy](http://discourse.transformap.co/t/what-is-the-current-status-of-openstreetmap-proposal/338), development of the [tools](http://discourse.transformap.co/t/which-tools-are-available-for-mapping-month-march/265) we offer so far, communication processes, and more.
