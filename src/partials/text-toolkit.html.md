## Toolkit

We are providing you with tools and support to add Points of Interest (POIs) and even more alternative maps to the TransforMap data scape. Consider your participants and their data to decide which of these tools fits best for your mapping event:

[TransforMap&nbsp;Editor](http://editor.transformap.co/) | [MMM&nbsp;Datawiki](http://mmm.3oe.de/) | [uMap](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/)
--- | --- | ---
*Map the alternatives!* | *Mapping of Mappings.* | *Your own map?*
Directly save to OpenStreetMap (OSM) and strengthen their global knowledge commons. | Forms, tables and lists for Non-OSM data, i.e. hypothetical or non-permanent records. | Create a custom map in five minutes, including im- & export, layers plus styling.
