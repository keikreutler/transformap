### <i class="fa fa-users fa-2x"></i> ###

Do you like the idea of TransforMap? And want to get involved? Here are a few ways you can choose to contribute:

*  **You have a database of initiatives**: open your data and get in touch. Let's discuss what kind of license will enable both maximum collaboration and the preservation of your interests.

*  **You have programming skills or are an organization with such skills at hand**: pool your technical resources with the TransforMap community. Visit [our Trello board](https://trello.com/b/adHSEyXl/engineering) to know what needs to be done on the software side.

*  **You are well connected to the local alternatives of your region**: why not try running a local test mapping using [TransforMapâ€™s Taxonomy](http://discourse.transformap.co/c/mapping-month-may-2015)? Check out the tools available [here](http://discourse.transformap.co/t/which-tools-are-available/265)!

Support with any other means, including in-kind donation, and get in touch via our global mailing list [global@lists.14mmm.org](http://lists.14mmm.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/global).
